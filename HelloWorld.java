/*public: meaning that the method can be called from anywhere mean from outside the program as well. See
Visibility for more information on this.
static: meaning it exists and can be run by itself (at the class level without creating an object).
void: meaning it returns no value. Note: This is unlike C and C++ where a return code such as int is expected
(Java's way is System.exit()).*/
